# TEXT-EDITOR-

A text editor is a program that allows us to create or edit programs and text files. Windows operating system is distributed with a text editor program called Notepad. Using the Notepad, we can create a new program file, modify an existing file, or display or print the contents of a file. It is important to realise that programs used for word processing, such as the Word, cannot be used as a text editor. This is because word processing programs are not true text editors as they embed word formatting characters such as bold, italic, underline, etc., inside the text.
